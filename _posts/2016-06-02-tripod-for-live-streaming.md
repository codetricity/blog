With $3 and 10 minutes of build time you can modify any tripod to work with the THETA S in live
streaming mode with a USB cable plugged in.

At my local hardware store, [OSH](http://www.osh.com/), I found all the
pieces I needed to build an adapter that allows the micro USB cable to be
plugged in while the THETA is mounted to a tripod.

- 1 pc 1/4" by 20 pitch rod coupling nut
- 1 pc 1/4" by 20 pitch threaded rod, 3 inches long
- 2 pcs 1/4" by 20 pitch hex jam nut

Use one hex jam nut to lock the rod coupling nut in place. Use the other
hex jam nut to lock the THETA in place.

You can now start [360 video live streaming](http://theta360.guide/community-document/community.html#_video_live_streaming).

and build an app for fun, knowledge and fortune.
