This blog post is a translation
[from the original Japanese post](http://hima-zinn.hatenablog.com/entry/2015/12/13/000000) by
[hima_zinn](http://hima-zinn.hatenablog.com/about) from his
[Lazy Game Programmer Diary](http://hima-zinn.hatenablog.com/) on the Hatena Blog,
a famous blogging service in Japan like Word Press. It was originally published December 13, 2015. But I wanted to translate it since I think the details for quickly using the RICOH THETA API to get rid of the shutter sound is pretty cool and easy to implement.

Also, the functionality has since been added to the main THETA S app. So if you're looking for a quicker fix, check Settings --> Camera shutter volume.
Introduction

I'm a Theta fan that has all three generations of models. From left to right it's the THETA S, the THETA m15, and the THETA.
