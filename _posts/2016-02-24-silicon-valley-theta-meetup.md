In response to massive requests for THETA demos and developer
information after the
recent DeveloperWeek Hackathon in San Francisco, we've decided to
extend the hacking excitement to Silicon Valley.

We're planning an educational workshop and onsite hacking meetup with
loaner cameras.

## THETA 360 Camera Hacking Continues

We've made the
[THETA Unofficial Guides](http://theta360developers.github.io/)
hackathon documentation available online. However, we realize you may not
have a camera handy. If you're interested in attending a free THETA SF Bay
Area meetup where you can hack on the camera onsite, please send an email
to [ricohtheta360@oppkey.com](mailto:ricohtheta360@oppkey.com) and we'll add you to the invite list.

We'll cover the basics of the API and provide application templates to get
you going in less than 30 minutes. For rapid prototyping, we'll cover
Python and JavaScript, but you can use any language to control the camera
with the HTTP API. Stay and build your application.

Once we have critical mass, we'll schedule the day and place.
Join THETA Developers to take part in the fast-growing 360
image and video movement!
