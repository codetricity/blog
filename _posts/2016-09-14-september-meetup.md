## 360° Integration in Products, Photosphere Navigation, and 360° Video on Drones!

**RICOH THETA Developers Meetup**
**Tues, Sept 27, 2016**
**Location: San Francisco SOMA (TBD)**

Wow, we’ve got a great lineup of presenters to kick off the fall schedule of RICOH THETA meetups! Come join your fellow power users and 360 developers and find out more about integrating 360 video/VR/AR into products. Then spend some time thinking how you can navigate and connect photosphere content. And finally, who doesn’t want to stick a THETA on a drone? We’ll do it this coming Tues, Sept 27th.

Come ask your questions and share your own experiences in a friendly, relaxed environment. Whether you’re new to RICOH THETA, working on a project, or just want to meet people with similar interests, all are welcome.

## **How to Integrate 360 Video/VR/AR Into Your Product**

Kieran has a long background in video platform development running companies like Vidlet and Vidcaster, and now overseeing ecosystem and partner program development at Brightcove. Let his pain be your gain! He will dive into the nuts and bolts of how to stream 360º video standalone or as part of a larger product. Topics include: how to plan for and build the infrastructure, tying in a database, integrating with a CDN and either transcoding all of your video projects content into individual resolutions (ouch!) or using a solution to have a server do it for you (ahhh!). Make your product handle 360º video easily!

**Christian Claus** - Product Manager, Holobuilder (christian@holobuilder.com)

## **Better 360º Image Navigation Online**

Christian will walk us through some of the challenges and issues that arise when building a 360º platform that lets users navigate through photospheres. How do you keep from going around in circles? Or worse, getting bored? Christian will touch on good storytelling and the implication for business applications based on his experience at Holobuilder, where he focuses on 360º construction content.

**Eddie Codel** - Founder, Eddie.com/Flying Robot International Film Festival

## **RICOH THETA and Drones!**

Eddie will give us a “bird’s eye view” of video production using drones, including cutting-edge issues around mounting, stabilization, and avoiding curious birds. Eddie will also tell us about the Aerial Imaging Education Day he’s hosting in October and the Flying Robot International Film Festival and why THETA users in particular should participate.

Food and drinks will be provided by RICOH THETA. See you all there!
